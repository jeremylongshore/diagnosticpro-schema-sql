# Technical Specifications

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for the Database Schema Management project.

## Overview

Technical specifications provide detailed implementation guidance for features and components defined in PRDs. They bridge the gap between high-level requirements and actual code implementation.

## Structure

Specifications are organized by functional area and include:

- **System Architecture**: Overall system design and component interactions
- **Database Design**: Schema definitions, relationships, and constraints
- **API Specifications**: RESTful API endpoints, data models, and protocols
- **Data Pipeline**: ETL processes, data flow, and transformation logic
- **Integration Specs**: External system integration requirements
- **Security Specifications**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Performance Requirements**: Scalability, throughput, and response time specs

## Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
1. **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language
2. **Completeness**: Cover all technical aspects thoroughly
3. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
4. **Maintainability**: Keep specifications up-to-date with implementation

### Version Control
- Track changes to specifications
- Link to related code commits
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Review Process
- Technical review by senior engineers
- Stakeholder approval for interface changes
- Regular specification audits
