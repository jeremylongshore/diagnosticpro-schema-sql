# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Database Schema Management project.

## Overview

ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the schema management system. They provide context, reasoning, and consequences of technical decisions to help current and future team members understand why certain choices were made.

## Structure

ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.) and follow a standardized format to ensure consistency and completeness.

### ADR Status
- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made and approved
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant

## Guidelines

1. **Document Significant Decisions**: Focus on decisions that have long-term impact
2. **Be Concise**: Keep ADRs focused and to the point
3. **Include Context**: Explain the circumstances that led to the decision
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Document options that were considered
5. **Update Status**: Keep the status current as decisions evolve

## Template

Use the provided template (`adr-template.md`) for consistency across all ADRs.

## Current ADRs
