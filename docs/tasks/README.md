# Task Management

This directory contains task breakdowns, implementation plans, and project tracking for the Database Schema Management project.

## Overview

Tasks provide granular implementation steps derived from PRDs and specifications. They serve as actionable work items that can be assigned, tracked, and completed by development teams.

## Structure

### Task Categories
- **Development Tasks**: Code implementation and testing
- **Database Tasks**: Schema changes and data migration
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: Deployment and environment setup
- **Documentation Tasks**: Technical writing and updates
- **Bug Fixes**: Issue resolution and patches
- **Research Tasks**: Investigation and proof-of-concept work

### Task Status
- **Backlog**: Identified but not yet prioritized
- **Todo**: Ready for implementation
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review**: Completed and awaiting review
- **Done**: Completed and approved
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Guidelines

### Task Definition
1. **Clear Scope**: Each task should have a well-defined deliverable
2. **Actionable**: Tasks should be concrete and implementable
3. **Sized Appropriately**: Tasks should be completable within a sprint
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear completion criteria
5. **Dependencies**: Identify blockers and prerequisites

### Task Management Process
1. **Creation**: Tasks derived from PRDs and specifications
2. **Estimation**: Size tasks using story points or time estimates
3. **Assignment**: Assign to appropriate team members
4. **Tracking**: Monitor progress and update status
5. **Review**: Code review and quality assurance
6. **Completion**: Mark done when acceptance criteria met

## Task Templates

Use the provided templates for consistency:
- `feature-task-template.md`: For new feature development
- `bug-fix-template.md`: For bug fixes and issues
- `research-task-template.md`: For investigation work

## Current Sprint

### Sprint Goals
*Define current sprint objectives and key deliverables*

### Active Tasks
*List tasks currently in progress*

### Completed Tasks
*List tasks completed this sprint*

### Blocked Tasks
*List tasks that are blocked and their blockers*

## Backlog Management

### Prioritization Criteria
- Business value and impact
- Technical dependencies
- Resource availability
- Risk and complexity

### Epic Breakdown
Large features are broken down into epics, which are further broken down into tasks.

## Integration

Tasks are linked to:
- **PRDs**: Requirements that drive the task
- **ADRs**: Architectural decisions that impact implementation
- **Specifications**: Technical details for implementation
- **Code Repositories**: Implementation commits and branches
