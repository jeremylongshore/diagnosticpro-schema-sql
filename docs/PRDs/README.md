# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents for the Database Schema Management project.

## Overview

PRDs define the business and technical requirements for features and components within the schema management system. Each PRD should clearly articulate the problem being solved, target users, success metrics, and technical requirements.

## Structure

Each PRD should follow the standardized template and include:

- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the feature/component
- **Problem Statement**: What problem are we solving?
- **Target Users**: Who will use this feature?
- **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success?
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Considerations**: Architecture, dependencies, constraints
- **Timeline**: Development phases and milestones

## Guidelines

1. **One PRD per major feature**: Keep scope focused and manageable
2. **Stakeholder Review**: All PRDs should be reviewed by relevant stakeholders
3. **Living Documents**: Update PRDs as requirements evolve
4. **Traceability**: Link PRDs to ADRs, specifications, and tasks

## Templates

Use the provided template (`prd-template.md`) as a starting point for new PRDs.
