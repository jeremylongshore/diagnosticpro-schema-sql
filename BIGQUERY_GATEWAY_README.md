# 🌐 BIGQUERY GATEWAY DIRECTORY
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** ✅ CLEAN GATEWAY STRUCTURE

## 📊 PURPOSE
This directory serves as the **gateway to BigQuery** for all data uploads. The schema has been successfully uploaded to BigQuery, and this directory now maintains only the essential data pipeline.

## 📁 CURRENT STRUCTURE

```
/home/jeremy/projects/schema/
├── datapipeline_import/      # ⭐ ACTIVE PIPELINE
│   ├── pending/              # Data awaiting validation
│   ├── validated/            # Data passed validation
│   ├── failed/               # Data that failed validation
│   └── imported/             # Successfully imported to BigQuery
├── .env                      # Environment configuration

└── ARCHIVE_*/                # Archived old system files
```

## 🔄 DATA FLOW TO BIGQUERY

```
Data Sources → datapipeline_import/pending → Validation → BigQuery Upload
                                    ↓
                                 failed/
```

## ✅ WHAT WAS DONE

### Archived (No longer needed):
- All Python scripts and shell scripts
- Old API and migration directories
- Cloud Functions and Dataflow templates
- Test functions and sample code
- SQL deployment scripts
- Documentation and readme files
- Backup snapshots

### Preserved (Essential for gateway):
- `datapipeline_import/` - The core pipeline structure
- Environment configuration files
- Archive directories for reference

## 🚀 BIGQUERY INTEGRATION

The schema is now live in BigQuery with:
- **Project:** diagnostic-pro-start-up
- **Primary Dataset:** diagnosticpro_prod (PRODUCTION)
- **Tables:** 266 production tables including:
  - users & authentication system
  - universal_equipment_registry
  - diagnostic_sessions & reports
  - vehicle management system
  - billing & payment processing
  - And 261 more production tables...

## 📝 USAGE

### To send data to BigQuery:

1. **Place data in pending:**
   ```bash
   cp your_data.json datapipeline_import/pending/
   ```

2. **Validate data:**
   - Data moves from `pending/` to `validated/` if it passes
   - Failed data goes to `failed/` with error logs

3. **Upload to BigQuery:**
   - Validated data is uploaded to BigQuery
   - Successfully uploaded data moves to `imported/`

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE

- **pending/**: Check regularly for new data
- **validated/**: Process for BigQuery upload
- **failed/**: Review and fix data issues
- **imported/**: Archive or clean periodically

## 📊 STATUS

- **Schema:** ✅ Uploaded to BigQuery
- **Pipeline:** ✅ Operational
- **Gateway:** ✅ Clean and organized
- **Archives:** ✅ Old system preserved in ARCHIVE_OLD_SYSTEM/

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. Configure automated BigQuery upload scripts
2. Set up monitoring for the pipeline
3. Implement automated validation rules
4. Create data quality reports

**This directory is now optimized as a clean gateway to BigQuery.**
